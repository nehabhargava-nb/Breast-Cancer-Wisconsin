# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin
The present classification task is to predict whether someone has breast cancer or not. The dataset used here is a version of a breast cancer database published by the University of Wisconsin Hospitals. The original data set was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/ ). The dataset has 613 rows and 31 columns.
The following packages were used for the analysis:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn/Sklearn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Conclusions from the analysis:
- Logistic Regression has the highest accuracy on the PCA transformed dataset
- The accuracy was 97.82
- Logisctic regression also had the least number of false negatives when PCA transformed dataset was used.
